git clone https://github.com/AMTitan/video-sharing-website.git
cd video-sharing-website
cargo run --release

## Edit

If you want to edit how the website looks you can just change the `.html` pages in `www`.

404.html - 404 page  
index.html - home/landing page  
video.html - video page  

With the video page where ever it says `$video_id` it will replace it with the id of the video the user wants to see ex. `BKyV9jL99S`

Also just know that if you change any of the html files while the program is running it will change for everyone instantly.
